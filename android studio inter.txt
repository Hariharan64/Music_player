1. What is Java?
Answer:
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

2. What are the main features of Java?
Answer:

Object-Oriented: Everything is an object.
Platform-Independent: Write once, run anywhere (WORA).
Simple and Secure: Easy to learn with strong security features.
Robust: Strong memory management, exception handling, and garbage collection.
Multithreaded: Supports multithreading and concurrent processing.
Portable: Bytecode can be carried to any platform.
High Performance: Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for improved performance.
Dynamic: Supports dynamic linking and loading of classes.
3. Explain the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM.
Answer:

JDK (Java Development Kit): A software development kit required to develop Java applications. It includes the JRE and development tools like compilers and debuggers.
JRE (Java Runtime Environment): Provides the libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run applications written in Java. It does not include development tools.
JVM (Java Virtual Machine): An abstract machine that enables your computer to run a Java program. It converts Java bytecode into machine language.
4. What is a Class in Java?
Answer:
A class in Java is a blueprint from which individual objects are created. A class can contain fields (variables) and methods to define the behavior of an object.

5. What is an Object in Java?
Answer:
An object is an instance of a class. It has state (attributes/fields) and behavior (methods). Objects are created using the new keyword.

6. What are constructors in Java?
Answer:
Constructors are special methods that are called when an object is instantiated. They are used to initialize the object. A constructor has the same name as the class and does not have a return type.

7. Explain the concept of inheritance in Java.
Answer:
Inheritance is a mechanism in Java by which one class can inherit the fields and methods of another class. The class that inherits is called the subclass, and the class being inherited from is called the superclass. Inheritance promotes code reuse.

8. What is polymorphism in Java?
Answer:
Polymorphism in Java allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. It enables a single method to operate in different ways on different objects. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

9. What is encapsulation in Java?
Answer:
Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together as a single unit. It restricts direct access to some of the objectâ€™s components, which can be accessed only through public methods (getters and setters).

10. What is abstraction in Java?
Answer:
Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

11. What is an interface in Java?
Answer:
An interface in Java is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Interfaces cannot contain instance fields or constructors. They are used to achieve full abstraction and multiple inheritance.

12. What is an abstract class in Java?
Answer:
An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed. It can contain abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation). Abstract classes are used to provide a common interface for subclasses.

13. Explain method overloading and method overriding.
Answer:

Method Overloading: Occurs when two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters (different type, number, or both).
Method Overriding: Occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method already defined in its superclass. The method in the subclass must have the same signature as the one in the superclass.
14. What is the difference between == and equals() in Java?
Answer:

==: Compares the reference (memory address) of two objects to check if they point to the same object.
equals(): Compares the actual content of two objects to check if they are logically equal. The equals() method can be overridden to provide custom equality logic.
15. What is the significance of the final keyword in Java?
Answer:

final variable: Its value cannot be changed once initialized.
final method: Cannot be overridden by subclasses.
final class: Cannot be subclassed.
16. What is a static variable and a static method?
Answer:

Static Variable: A class-level variable that is shared among all instances of the class. It is declared with the static keyword.
Static Method: A method that belongs to the class rather than any particular instance. It can be called without creating an instance of the class.
17. Explain the concept of exception handling in Java.
Answer:
Exception handling in Java is managed via five keywords: try, catch, throw, throws, and finally. Code that might throw an exception is placed in the try block, exceptions are caught using catch blocks, and finally block contains code that will execute regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.

java
Copy code
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (ExceptionType name) {
    // Code to handle the exception
} finally {
    // Code that will execute regardless of an exception
}
18. What are Java collections?
Answer:
Java collections are frameworks that provide an architecture to store and manipulate a group of objects. Examples include List, Set, Map, and Queue.

19. What is garbage collection in Java?
Answer:
Garbage collection in Java is the process by which the Java runtime automatically removes objects that are no longer referenced by the program. This helps in managing memory and avoiding memory leaks.

20. Explain the synchronized keyword in Java.
Answer:
The synchronized keyword in Java is used to control the access of multiple threads to a shared resource. When a method or block is synchronized, only one thread can execute it at a time, ensuring thread safety.

21. What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?
Answer:

ArrayList: Based on a dynamic array, it allows fast random access to elements but slow insertion and deletion operations (except at the end).
LinkedList: Based on a doubly linked list, it allows fast insertion and deletion operations but slower random access to elements.
22. What is the Java Stream API?
Answer:
The Java Stream API, introduced in Java 8, is used for processing sequences of elements. It allows functional-style operations on collections of objects, such as filtering, mapping, and reducing.

23. What is the significance of the transient keyword?
Answer:
The transient keyword in Java is used to indicate that a field should not be serialized. When an object is serialized, the transient fields are not included in the serialized representation.

24. Explain the difference between String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer.
Answer:

String: Immutable and thread-safe.
StringBuilder: Mutable and not thread-safe, suitable for single-threaded environments.
StringBuffer: Mutable and thread-safe, suitable for multi-threaded environments.
25. What is a lambda expression in Java?
Answer:
A lambda expression, introduced in Java 8, provides a clear and concise way to represent one method interface using an expression. It enables functional programming and can be used primarily to define the inline implementation of a functional interface.

java
Copy code
// Example of a lambda expression
Runnable runnable = () -> System.out.println("Hello, World!");

ConstraintLayout: A more flexible layout manager for creating complex layouts with a flat view hierarchy.
FrameLayout: Designed to block out an area on the screen to display a single item.
GridLayout: Places children in a rectangular grid.
14. How do you handle different screen sizes and densities in Android?
Answer:
To handle different screen sizes and densities in Android:

Use dp (density-independent pixels) for layout dimensions.
Use sp (scale-independent pixels) for text sizes.
Provide different resource sets for different screen sizes and densities (e.g., drawable-mdpi, drawable-hdpi, drawable-xhdpi).
